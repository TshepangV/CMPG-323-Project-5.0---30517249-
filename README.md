##High level matrics page
This is the summary page that helps the stakeholders analyse the whole report, the is a count visual that counts the items recorded in each table, theres a filter list that filters devises table based on isactive and status and it affect every visual on the page besides the category count, zone count and subcategory count since they dont have a common element links the devices with them.
we also have count number of devices by date shouwing the amount of devices on different dates. Lastly we have a key measure that counts the number of categories and status base on isactive.

##Devise mornitoring
We have a donut chart visualizing to the users the relationship of zone by devices name, pie chart showing when devices where online or offline using the status and lastly I use the treemap to help users monitor categories by device name.

##Device  Registration
The line chart visualisies the amount of devices registered by time, The waterfall chart shows the users how many zones contain registered devices over time using date installed and the card chart displays the number of categories in the device table.

##Filtering page
On this page I have four slicers nameley category id, zone id, date installed and device name. Each are filtering data across all the pages using sync filter to do that. Every visual and chart or graph is affected by all the four filters.
